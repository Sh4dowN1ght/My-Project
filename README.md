## Overview
This repository contains a sample Python script that demonstrates several techniques commonly observed in malicious Windows programs (persistence, keylogging, privilege escalation attempts, and reverse shell behavior). The materials are provided strictly for **research, education, and defensive** purposes — to help security analysts, incident responders, and researchers study behavior patterns and develop detection signatures.

> **WARNING:** The code discussed in this repository performs harmful actions if executed. Do **not** run the code on production systems, third-party systems, or any environment without explicit written authorization from the system owner.

## High-level description
The sample demonstrates, at a conceptual level, the following behaviors (non-operational summary):

- **Persistence mechanisms** — techniques used to maintain execution across reboots (file placement and autorun registry entries).
- **Privilege escalation vectors** — patterns that attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC) or otherwise elevate privileges.
- **Keylogging behavior** — capturing keyboard input for local storage.
- **Command-and-control / reverse shell patterns** — opening outbound connections to receive remote commands.
- **Anti-analysis checks** — basic checks to detect virtualized or analysis environments and prevent execution.

This README is intentionally descriptive only. It does **not** provide commands, configuration examples, or any operational guidance for executing or deploying the sample.

## Intended use & legal notice
- Use this repository **only** for legitimate research, education, threat-hunting, or defensive development.
- Run any analysis **only** on systems you own, or in a properly isolated and authorized lab environment.
- Unauthorized use or deployment of malware is illegal and unethical. The repository owner and contributors are **not** liable for misuse.

## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) — detection-oriented
The following items are provided to assist defenders in building detection rules and conducting investigations. These are examples and **not** exhaustive.

- Example file paths commonly used for persistence (monitor for unexpected files in user roaming folders).
- Unexpected autorun registry entries under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
- Temporary or short-lived modifications to `HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\Shell\Open\command` (observed in some UAC bypass techniques).
- Local files containing keystroke logs stored in user profile directories.
- Outbound TCP connections to unusual IPs/ports from non-networking applications.
- Creation of mutexes with suspicious or non-standard names.
- Processes that change console/window attributes or use process names commonly associated with system services (e.g., `svchost.exe`) but run from user locations.

> Use these indicators to create non-destructive detection rules (EDR, SIEM, IDS). Do not include executable payloads or live attack instructions in detection rule repositories.

## Recommended defensive controls
- Enforce least privilege for user accounts. Avoid running daily tasks with administrative rights.
- Monitor and restrict modifications to autorun registry keys and common persistence locations.
- Deploy endpoint detection capable of identifying keyboard hooks, unusual process creation, and suspicious outbound connections.
- Block or flag common privilege escalation patterns and abnormal `fodhelper.exe`/`ms-settings` interactions.
- Maintain robust network monitoring and egress filtering to detect and block suspicious outbound connections.
- Regularly backup systems and maintain tested incident response playbooks.

## Safe analysis guidelines (for researchers)
If you are an authorized researcher analyzing this sample, follow strict safety controls:
- Use isolated virtual machines with no bridges to production networks.
- Disable shared folders, clipboard sharing, and host–guest integrations that leak data.
- Capture full snapshots before and after analysis; keep logs, network captures (pcap), and registry hives for forensic review.
- Perform analysis on disposable VMs and destroy snapshots (or revert) after use.

---

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome when they strengthen defensive capabilities and documentation. Acceptable contributions include:
- Additional non-executable IOCs (JSON/CSV) and threat-hunting rules.
- SIEM/EDR rule suggestions (rule text only — **do not** include runnable payloads).
- Expanded analysis notes and references to public research.

Contributions that facilitate exploitation, distribution, or operational use will be rejected.
